#Computational Musicology
##Portfolio by MariÃ«lle Baelemans



For my portfolio project I want to use the findings out of an earlier Musicology project. In my research on what makes music 'sad' I found that the minor aspect is the thing what makes music sad. Besides that aspect, also slowness and low pitch are important for giving a listener a sad feeling. My big goal for this portfolio project is to make a widget that measures how sad someone's playlist is by comparing these factors in a 3:2:1 ratio. For now this is a too big goal, so my first step is to compare the major/minor- ratio and the mean tempo of my own playlist to 'Top 100 Nederland' playlist.
